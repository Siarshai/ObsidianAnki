Anki-ish tool for spaced learning. 

* Globs *.md files from designated directory, treats their names as questions and content as answers.
* Shows questions semi-randomly, then asks you if you got the answer right. 
* Wrong answers to questions make script ask them more frequently. Right answers - less frequently.
* Recently answered questions are asked less frequently.
* Progress is saved on disk.

Somewhat overengineered for project of this size :)
